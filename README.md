<p>Hilbert curve in two-dimensional space</p>
<p>To construct this fractal, the Lindenmeier system was used</p>
<p>Aplhabet: A, B</p>
<p>F: forward</p>
<p>+: right turn</p>
<p>-: left turn</p>
<p>2d</p>
<p>A -> -BF+AFA+FB-</p>
<p>B -> +AF-BFB-FA+</p>
<p>Hilbert curve in three-dimensional space</p>
<p>To construct the Hilbert curve in a three-dimensional space, the Gray code was used</p>

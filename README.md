<p>Hilbert curve in two-dimensional space</p>
<p>To construct this fractal, the Lindenmeier system was used</p>
<code>Aplhabet: A, B</code>
<code>F: forward</code>
<code>+: right turn</code>
<code>-: left turn</code>
<code>2d</code>
<code>A -> -BF+AFA+FB-</code>
<code>B -> +AF-BFB-FA+</code>
<p>Hilbert curve in three-dimensional space</p>
<p>To construct the Hilbert curve in a three-dimensional space, the Gray code was used</p>
